## Part I - Statistics & Probability
Statistics were computed to find out the probabilities of converting regardless of page. These were used to analyze if one page or the other led to more conversions.


## Part II - A/B Test
hypothesis testing was conducted assuming the old page is better unless the new page proves to be definitely better at a Type, error rate of 5%. The data was bootstrapped and sampled distributions were determined for both pages. Conclusions were drawn on conversions for both pages by calculating p-values.

## Part III - Regression
Logistic regression was then performed to confirm results the hypothesis testing. Null and alternative hypotheses associated with this regression model were stated and verified using statsmodel.
